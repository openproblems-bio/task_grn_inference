  geneRNIB is a living benchmark platform for GRN inference. This platform provides curated datasets for GRN inference and evaluation, standardized evaluation protocols and metrics, computational infrastructure, and a dynamically updated leaderboard to track state-of-the-art methods. It runs novel GRNs in the cloud, offers competition scores, and stores them for future comparisons, reflecting new developments over time.

  The platform supports the integration of new inference methods, datasets and protocols. When a new feature is added, previously evaluated GRNs are re-assessed, and the leaderboard is updated accordingly. The aim is to evaluate both the accuracy and completeness of inferred GRNs. It is designed for both single-modality and multi-omics GRN inference. 
  
  In the current version, geneRNIB contains 10 inference methods including both single and multi-omics, 8 evalation metrics, and five datasets. 
  
  See our publication for the details of methods.

      ## Installation

      You need to have Docker, Java, and Viash installed. Follow
      [these instructions](https://openproblems.bio/documentation/fundamentals/requirements)
      to install the required dependencies. 

      ## Download resources
      ```bash
      git clone --recursive git@github.com:openproblems-bio/task_grn_inference.git

      cd task_grn_inference
      ```
      To interact with the framework, you should download the resources containing necessary inferene and evaluation datasets to get started. 
      Here, we download the test resources which are used for testing the framework. Refer to the [Documentation](https://genernib-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for downloading the actual datasets.

      ```bash
      scripts/download_resources.sh
      ```

      ## Run a GRN inference method 

      To infer a GRN for a given dataset (e.g. `op`) using simple Pearson correlation:

      ```bash
      viash run src/control_methods/pearson_corr/config.vsh.yaml -- 
                  --rna resources_test/grn_benchmark/inference_data/op_rna.h5ad
                  --prediction output/net.h5ad 
                  --tf_all resources_test/grn_benchmark/prior/tf_all.csv
      ```

      ## Evaluate a GRN prediction
      Once got the prediction for a given dataset (e.g. op), use the following code to obtain evaluation scores. 
      
      ```bash
      scripts/single_grn_evaluation.sh output/net.h5ad op
      ```

      This outputs the scores into `output/test_run/scores.yaml`

      ## Add a GRN inference method, evaluation metric, or dataset

      To add a new component to the repository, follow the [Documentation](https://genernib-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
