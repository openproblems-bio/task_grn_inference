GRN evaluation
=================
The evaluation metrics used in geneRNIB are summarized below. For a detailed description of each metric, refer to the geneRNIB paper.

We define **eight evaluation metrics**, grouped into three categories: **Regression 1, Regression 2, and Wasserstein Distance**.

- The **regression-based metrics** assess the predictive power of an inferred GRN by using regression models to predict perturbation data (evaluation data) based on the feature space constructed from the inferred network.  
- The **Wasserstein distance-based metric** evaluates GRN edges by measuring the distributional shift in target gene expression between observations and perturbation data for a given transcription factor (TF).

The evaluation metrics expect the inferred network to be in the form of an AnnData object with specific format as explained here. It should be noted that the metric currently evaluate only the **top TF-gene pairs**, currently limited to **50,000 edges**, ranked by their assigned weight.  

The inferred network should have a tabular format with the following columns:  

  - `source`: TF gene name
  - `target`: Target gene gene  
  - `weight`: Regulatory importance/likelihood score/etc.  

See `resources_test/grn_models/op/collectri.h5ad` for an example of the expected format.
