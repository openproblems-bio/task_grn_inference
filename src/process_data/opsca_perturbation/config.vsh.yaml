  summary: "Porcesses sc counts of perturbation data to generate pseudobulked normalized data"
  description: |
    It conducts QC on sc level to remove low quality cell and genes. 
    Then, sc counts are pseudobulked and filtered for outliers compounds, samples with low quality cells, and genes with low coverage. 
    Finally, it normalized the counts data.
