  description: "GRNs are essential for understanding cellular identity and behavior.\
    \ They are simplified models of gene expression regulated by complex processes\
    \ involving multiple layers of control, from transcription to post-transcriptional\
    \ modifications, incorporating various regulatory elements and non-coding RNAs.\
    \ Gene transcription is controlled by a regulatory complex that includes transcription\
    \ factors (TFs), cis-regulatory elements (CREs) like promoters and enhancers,\
    \ and essential co-factors. High-throughput datasets, covering thousands of genes,\
    \ facilitate the use of machine learning approaches to decipher GRNs. The advent\
    \ of single-cell sequencing technologies, such as scRNA-seq, has made it possible\
    \ to infer GRNs from a single experiment due to the abundance of samples. This\
    \ allows researchers to infer condition-specific GRNs, such as for different cell\
    \ types or diseases, and study potential regulatory factors associated with these\
    \ conditions. Combining chromatin accessibility data with gene expression measurements\
    \ has led to the development of enhancer-driven GRN (eGRN) inference pipelines,\
    \ which offer significantly improved accuracy over single-modality methods.\n\n\
    Here, we present geneRNIB as a living benchmark platform for GRN inference. This\
    \ platform provides curated datasets for GRN inference and evaluation, standardized\
    \ evaluation protocols and metrics, computational infrastructure, and a dynamically\
    \ updated leaderboard to track state-of-the-art methods. It runs novel GRNs in\
    \ the cloud, offers competition scores, and stores them for future comparisons,\
    \ reflecting new developments over time.\n\nThe platform supports the integration\
    \ of new datasets and protocols. When a new feature is added, previously evaluated\
    \ GRNs are re-assessed, and the leaderboard is updated accordingly. The aim is\
    \ to evaluate both the accuracy and completeness of inferred GRNs. It is designed\
    \ for both single-modality and multi-omics GRN inference. Ultimately, it is a\
    \ community-driven platform. \n\nSo far, ten GRN inference methods have been integrated:\
    \ five single-omics methods of GRNBoost2, GENIE3, Portia, PPCOR, and Scenic; and\
    \ five eGRN inference methods of Scenic+, CellOracle, FigR, scGLUE, and GRaNIE.\n\
    \nDue to its flexible nature, the platform can incorporate various benchmark datasets\
    \ and evaluation methods, using either prior knowledge or feature-based approaches.\
    \ \nIn the current version, due to the absence of standardized prior knowledge,\
    \ we use indirect approaches to benchmark GRNs. Employing interventional data\
    \ as evaluation datasets, we have developed 8 metrics using feature-based approach\
    \ and Wasserstein distance, accounting for both accuracy and comprehensiveness.\n\
    \nFive datasets have been integrated so far, namely OPSCA, Nakatake, Norman, Adamson,\
    \ and Replogle. For each dataset, standardized inference datasets are provided\
    \ to be used for GRN inference and evaluation datasets are employed to benchmark.\n\
    See our publication for the details of methods. \n"

    readme: "## Installation\n\nYou need to have Docker, Java, and Viash installed.\
      \ Follow\n[these instructions](https://openproblems.bio/documentation/fundamentals/requirements)\n\
      to install the required dependencies. \n\n## Download resources\n```bash\ngit\
      \ clone git@github.com:openproblems-bio/task_grn_inference.git\n\ncd task_grn_inference\n\
      \n# download resources\nscripts/download_resources.sh\n```\nThe datasets for\
      \ GRN inference are located in `resources/inference_datasets`. \n## Infer a\
      \ GRN \nOne GRN should be inferred for each inference dataset (op, norman, replogle2,\
      \ adamson, and nakatake). The inferred GRN should have three columns of `source,\
      \ target, weight`. See `resources/grn_models/op/grnboost2.csv` as an example.\n\
      \n## Evaluate a GRN\nOnce a GRN is inferred (e.g. located in `output/your_GRN.csv`)\
      \ for a given dataset (e.g. `norman`), use the following code to obtain evaluation\
      \ scores. \n```bash\nscripts/calculate_score.sh output/your_GRN.csv norman\n\
      ```\nThis will calculate and print the scores as well as output the scores into\
      \ `output/score.h5ad`\n\n## Add a method\n\nTo add a method to the repository,\
      \ follow the instructions in the `scripts/add_a_method.sh` script.\n"
